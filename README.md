# ML Paper Discovery
Community driven ML research discovery

## Problem

The ML research community faces an unprecedented information overload. The explosion of papers it nearly impossible for researchers to identify genuinely important work among the noise.

## Mission

Building tools to help ML researchers efficiently discover high-quality, relevant papers through community-driven filtering.

## Status
	
- Conducting user research with ML researchers
- Analyzing citation patterns and discovery workflows
- Prototyping initial solutions

## Get Involved

Seeking ML researchers willing to share their experiences with paper discovery and information overload. If you're frustrated with current tools, I'd love to hear your perspective.
